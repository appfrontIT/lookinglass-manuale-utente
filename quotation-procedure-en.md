# Quotation procedure (EN)

### What is a Quotation?

A quotation is a contractual offer that includes the policyholder’s personal details, selected insurance coverages, and the total premium to be paid. Once the quotation is issued, it becomes immutable and forms the basis for policy issuance.

### How to Create a Quotation

There are two entry points to create a new quotation on the Lookinglass platform:

* From the main menu: navigate to _Applications_ and select _Quotations_
* From the dashboard: access _Policy Issuance_ from the sidebar

### Quotation Workflow Overview

The quoting process is divided into six panels:

* License Plate
* Contract Data
* Personal Data
* Coverages
* Discounts
* Summary

Each panel is mandatory and must be completed in order.

### License Plate Panel

The user must enter details about the insured vehicle, starting with ownership type:

* Already Owner
* First Registration
* Ownership Transfer (PRA)
* Plate Replacement
* Vintage Car
* CVT Only (optional protection products)

Upon entering the license plate and selecting the ownership type, the system queries ANIA to retrieve vehicle and policyholder data. These fields are automatically filled and locked.

The system also checks for fiscal code or license plate blacklist. If the subject or vehicle is blacklisted, the process is immediately blocked.

The tax code (fiscal code) is retrieved from SIVI/ANIA. It can be edited manually only if the user has valid supporting documentation, as specified in the platform.

If the risk class (ATR) is linked to a different vehicle, the user can select recovery options such as:

* From demolished, sold, or stolen vehicle
* From a deceased or family member
* Bersani (same owner or cohabiting relative)

Finally, the user completes any missing technical data by referencing the vehicle registration document.

### Contract Data Panel

This panel includes policy start and end dates, intermediary and agency identifiers, payment frequency (annual or semi-annual), and financing information (if applicable).

The expiration date is automatically calculated based on the start date and the selected installment plan. A semi-annual option includes a 3% surcharge.

The system enforces a minimum valid start date based on ANIA data.

### Personal Data Panel

This section captures policyholder and owner details, residence and domicile addresses, and contact information.

If the policyholder and vehicle owner are different, both sets of data must be entered.

Address fields are populated based on official documents such as identity cards, residence certificates (ANPR), and tax information. The user must indicate whether the policyholder is also the primary driver.

Contact details (email, phone) are mandatory.

### Coverages Panel

The user selects the insurance product and optional guarantees. Available products include:

* Motor liability for cars, vintage vehicles, motorcycles, scooters, trucks, vans, and trailers

Optional coverages include:

* Theft and Fire
* Roadside Assistance
* Driver’s Accident Protection
* Glass and Weather Events
* KasKo
* Collision
* Cash Back

Each option is subject to underwriting rules that are automatically validated. If rules are not satisfied, approval from underwriting (IPA) is required to proceed.

### Discounts Panel

This section displays a breakdown of the premium calculation in tabular form:

* Selected guarantees
* Net premium (before discount)
* Discount (based on eligibility and intermediary agreements)
* Net premium after discount
* Fixed policy fees
* Accessories (additional products)
* Taxes and contributions
* Gross premium (final amount)

A color indicator shows whether the discount is applicable. If ineligible, the reason is displayed.

Changing a discount requires updating the values and refreshing the page to recalculate the gross premium.

### Summary Panel

The user reviews all data entered across the six panels.

If corrections are needed, it is possible to return to the relevant step. Once confirmed, the following documents must be uploaded:

* Vehicle registration document
* Identity document
* Privacy consent
* Additional documents if applicable:
  * Family certificate (for Bersani or ATR transfers)
  * Adequacy questionnaire
  * Any documentation required by the underwriting process

The quotation can then be printed and shared with the customer for review and acceptance.

### Questionnaire and Final Verification

Before issuing the policy, the user must complete a multiple-choice questionnaire with the client. The completed questionnaire must be signed, scanned, and uploaded to the system, together with the privacy form and any additional documents.

If digital signature is enabled for the user role, a document signing session can be initiated, completed partially, and resumed later. Deleting a session does not invalidate previously signed documents.

### Policy Issuance

Once all validations are passed, the system performs a final ANIA data check and revalidates underwriting rules. The policy is then officially issued.

The policy can be printed and is also available for download from the system.

A signed copy of the policy declaration page (simplo) must be emailed within 60 days to the address specified by the company.

### Modifying a Quotation

Quotations can be modified depending on their status:

* **Incomplete quotations** can be edited by locating them in the Quotations section and clicking the _Edit_ button.
* **Issued quotations** cannot be modified. To make changes, use the _Duplicate_ function to create a new quotation based on the existing one.
